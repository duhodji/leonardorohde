                                    Leo created this video as his final project for a class on 3D animation at BMCC. The assighment was to make an animation that included Vents, support pllars, Pipes, turbines, an opening door, and a window. Leo chose make the sci-fi hallway that you can see. All textures are from Cinema 4D. The main challenge in this animation was to render the light properly.

                                    Another BMCC class assignment, this time for a class on 2D animation. The prompt was to create an animated GIF of an object turning around using six frames for a full rotation (in Leo's rendering, an astronaut spinning). Because of the low frame rate, the end result has a vintage feel of 1970's Japanese cartoons.

                                    In this video, made for a class on Video Graphics at BMCC, Leo explored the parallax effect to create an illusion of 3D depth and immersion by moving foreground elements faster than background elements, and the camera in Adobe After Effects. He started by making two stop motion animations of the Mechs (giant, humanoid or animal-like machine piloted from the inside) drawing their sword on a green screen using Gundam figurines. After that, he imported the videos and the images of the last two frames in After Effects to remove the greenscreen and add effects and sounds.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    The eyes of the first Mech is a green rectangle placed behind the footage due to the fact that they were also green and disappeared during the greenscreen removal process. The lightsabers effects were made by using the lightning effect and turning down the forking and turbulence of the effect. For the camera, Leo used 3D Layers and placed the background and the first Mech, and all of its effects, back. The second Mech was placed on the foreground. The camera moved between the two. Most of the sound effects came from a game and one from an anime that Leo found while looking for sounds that fitted the animation.

                                    This project was for a Multimedia class at BMCC. Leo had to create a video with a Public Service Announcement (PSA), combining two different mediums learnt during the semester. Leo opted for Imaging and Animation, because they were the most suitable media for the PSA he had in mind. He drew inspiration from his daily commute in the New York City subway system.

Before Leo started animating, Mari, who is an artist, drew all the assets and recorded the reading of the poem. Leo then used the images and audio to produce the animation using After Effects.
